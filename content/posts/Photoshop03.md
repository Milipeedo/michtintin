{{< youtube 8OfC9pZMJKs>}}

## Introduction.
### 00:00-0:12

Hi Everyone, My name is Michele
And in this video

I will show you
How to extract

Any colours
from any picture

and create a gradient
and save it in the library

So let's get started
So once you've open up photoshop


## Importing the picture.
### 0:12-0:53:22
Import the picture
you want to extract the colours from

Go to file
place embedded

Click on the picture that you want to import
and then click place

Rotate it to landscape mode
Press shift and then once it

Turns to rotate toggle
It will snap to 90 degree angle

and then you press shift when the cursor
turns into this bi-directional arrow

Enlarge it
and then press enter

Move it to the middle
And now we will start

## Extracting colour
### 0:53-5:44

Extracting the different colours
in the pictures

Create a new layer
So in Layer 1

We will extract the darkest colour
Click on foreground colour

This is called foreground colour
And then once you clicked on foreground colour

You will see this Foreground Colour Picker
And then your cursor will

Change into colour picker icon
Select the first colour that you want to click

on
You can select the darkest or the lightest

Up to you
But I'll go with the darkest first

And then Click ok
Once you've selected the colour

Click on the Rectangle tool
and then draw a rectangle

Once you clicked on the Rectangle Tool
Make sure it's in pixel mode (Shape mode)

Click and press shift
and then let go

Next colour
Put it on the next layer

New Layer
Click on the foreground colour

And when the cursor has changed into a Colour
Picker icon

Select the next colour
that you want to pick

Click ok
Shift and Drag, Let go

Next colour we put it on
the next layer

New Layer
Click on the Foreground Colour

Third Colour
And then Draw your box,

Third Box
Doesn't have to be neat

You just need to make sure
that it's arranged in an order

that's easy to navigate
Foreground Colour

Lightest Blue
Click ok

Next box
New Layer

Rectangle tool
Pixel Mode(Shape mode instead)

Foreground Colour
Click ok

And then last but not least
New layer

There's a shortcut for New Layer
Shift command N

Then you can just press enter
Pick the sand colour

So here you go
Six new colours

For your new gradient
But if you want to create this blue band here

you can add another colour
By all means

on a new layer
and then

go in
Zoom in

as near as you can
So that you can see

Where
What colour you're picking

Ok then
Zoom out

Command minus
and then draw the

rectangle here
they are all in new layers

Now you're ready to create
your new gradient

Click on the gradient tool
And then

Click on the gradient editor
Click on the black handle

Then when you move the cursor to canvas
You will see

the colour picker
Just click on the first colour that you want

Darkest Colour you want on your left
And the you want to add the

Second , Third, Fourth and Fifth
Click on, below the bar here

Second Colour
Third

Third colour
Fourth

Fourth Colour
Fifth

Fifth Colour
And last Colour

Click on the handle before you
Click on the Colour

And now you adjust
When you finished picking all the colours

## Adjust the spread or width of each colour.
### 5:44-7:51

You adjust the width
Spread it out

If you accidentally added
Extra handles

Just Click and Pull it away from the bar
Adjust the width

Spread out the handles
The wider you spread it out

The more gradual the colour gradation is
So now I think we're done

Click ok
New Layer

Shift command N
Enter

Turn off everything
Except

the white background
So now you're ready to apply you're gradient

Shift, Click, Drag and Let go
If you're not happy with it

Command Z undo
Apply it to the whole canvas

And you will have
The gradient that you have created

If you're not happy with the gradation
and you want to adjust

Just double click
on the Gradient Editor

You can, if you want
You can add another colour

Click below the bar
and add a darker colour

to create a dark band
on top of the sand

And then adjust
The gradation

and then click ok
New Layer

Shift, Click, Drag
and Let go

So this is the gradation
that we have extracted


## Saving the gradient
### 7:51-8:32

If you want to save this gradation
And use it in the future

Click on this gear icon
New Gradient

You can name it as beach and sky
and click ok

So in the future if you want to use it
You can get it from your gradient library

Click, Drag and Let go
You can use it anytime you want
