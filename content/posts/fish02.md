# Transforming pure fish into cakes by hand using spanish mackerels, salt and pepper. No additives just pure fish.

{{< youtube podP7q_0t0U >}}

## Introduction and picking the right fish.
### 00:00-0:09
Hi Everyone, today we're making fish cakes and fish balls using spotted mackerel fish called Spanish mackerels.

## Removing the fish flesh from fillets.
### 0:09-1:13

Start by scraping the fillet as shown in the video.

Watch out for any bones and remove them.

Scrap the next piece of fillet.

Watch out at the stomach cavity area, avoid the part with blood clots as they tend to be fishy.

## Season and knead the fish dough.
### 1:15-2:32

Time to season and knead the fish flesh dough.

Add white pepper and salt.

Knead to mix and soften the texture of the flesh.

Wet your hands to avoid the flesh from sticking to your hands.

Throw it onto the chopping board to compact the dough, to avoid any bubbles inside the dough.

## Shape and cut the dough.
### 2:32-3:56

Shape the dough into a smooth ball and cut into thick slices of fish cakes.

Squeeze and scoop the dough with a spoon to make fish balls.

Place the balls into salted bowl of water to maintain its freshness.

This method doesn't require adding any flour or water. So it is low in carbohydrate. Pure fish protein.

## Fry the fish doughs into fish cakes and fish balls.
### 3:56-6:19
Lightly oil the wok and fry the fish cakes and balls in medium heat until brown.

Lack of oil and enough heat will cause the fish balls to stick.

Done!
## Bury the fish skin.
### 6:26-6:40
Bury the fish skin and bones near your vege plots, your plants will thank you!
