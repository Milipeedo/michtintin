# Transforming pure fish into cakes by hand using spanish mackerels, salt and pepper. No additives just pure fish.

{{< youtube -EMj8NScujg >}}

## Introduction and picking the right fish.
### 00:00-00:30
Hi! There. Do you wanna learn how to make fish cakes by hand?
Today we're going to show you just that. It's a very common ingredient in flat noodles, fried rice, noodles, fish soup noodles in Singapore and Malaysia. Not all types of mackerels are suitable to make fish cakes some don't hold up to their firmness and tend to be powdery so make sure you pick one with
spotted skin and request the fishmonger to fillet it for you, if I'm not wrong
it's called Japanese/ Spanish mackerels.

## Things you will need.
### 00:30-00:51

and before I start working on the fish cakes it's best to line the table with a layer of thick newspaper so that it's easier to clean later the other two ingredients you need are salt and white grounded pepper. You'll also need a saline solution with a ratio of one teaspoon to a cup of water. Dip your spoon into the saline solution and

## Start scraping the fish flesh into a bowl.
### 00:52-2:00

Gently start scraping from the top towards the skin. Break up the fillet into manageable sections and do it slowly watch out for bones along the length of
the middle spine. If you feel or see any bones remove them. Once you're done scraping, check to see if you missed out any bones, if not put
them aside. You may not proceed to scrap the next fillet.
Remember to scrap slowly and gently when you reach the stomach cavity. You can choose to throw away this part or you can be very careful to not
include any blood clots along the stomach lining.  It can smell very fishy.

## Season the flesh.
### 2:00-2:20

Once you're done place the fish into a bowl for seasoning and kneading. Add a bit of salt and white grounded pepper to taste. In this video we added about a quarter teaspoon of salt and pepper don't forget the saline solution also
adds salt into the fish. So when you add salt into a fish, do go sparingly. You
don't want to have a salty fish cake.

## Knead and compress the flesh dough.
### 2:20-3:30

In order to start kneading prepare a bowl
of fresh salted water once you've wet your hands with the salted
water press and fold with the heel of your palm. Keep kneading until the
consistency feels like a smooth paste, and the longer you knead, the finer the
texture. We did this for about 20 minutes and if you want it to be even finer, you
can use a cleaver to mince the dough, but today we are not going to give it the
mincing treatment. We don't mind a bit of lump in the fish cake, it feels more
homemade and rustic that way. If your arms get tired, you can pick up the dough and
slam it onto the chopping board. It's quite fun actually, but make sure you
have a sturdy table. If your hands get sticky remember to dip your hands into those salted water. When you have needed about 30 minutes it will feel smooth and springy .Compress in order to remove any bubbles and then shape it into a 2-inch thick disc.

## Cut the fish dough into 1 inch thick slices.
### 3:31-4:00

Next, get your knife and wet it with the salted water this will prevent your fish cake from sticking onto the blade. Cut your fish dough into 1 to 2 inch thick slices. If you see some muscle fibres still intact, don't worry about it, once you fry it, you won't be able to see it.

## Shape them into fish balls too.
### 4:01-4:30

Oh! and do you know you can also make fish balls out of these fish cakes just roll them up in your palm and squeeze and scoop, squeeze and scoop, it's that easy. Place all the fish balls into the salted water to retain the freshness, preferably covering the top of the fish balls. When you're ready let's move to the stuff to start frying.

## Fry the fish slices and balls until brown.
### 4:31-5:55

Heat up about 2 tbsp of cooking oil on your wok and when it starts smoking, lift your fish cakes gently onto the wok, you don't want them to break apart just at the last minute. Fry them at a medium heat until it is brown and that's it! You can let it cool and then slice them into thin pieces. Then you can add them into your fried noodles, Fried rice or any dishes. We should have added some cooking oil before we started frying the fish balls. As you can see the fish balls got stuck. So we added some more oil and continued to fry. Remember to be patient when you fry. The slower the fire, the less possibility that it will get burnt. Try not to turn it, if it sticks to the wok. That means it's not brown enough but patience is the virtue not bestowed upon everyone. I think a better way to cook these fish balls is to boil them in hot boiling water.

## What to do with the fish skin?
