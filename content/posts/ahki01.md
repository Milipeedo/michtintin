# A Dog's life....it can be tiring sometimes.

{{< youtube 7Fv4KFOwBsA>}}

## Early morning routine.
### 0:06:10-1:14:11
Here's to the moments when you realise simple
things in life are wonderful and enough.

by Jill Badonsky.

Time to wake up!!!

Quick stretch!!

Quick run for breakfast!

Me : Do you want to eat bread?

Ah ki: YES!

Yum!

Yummy!!Nom Nom!!

Ah ki: My raw egg first!


## Busy day begins.
### 1:14:11 - 3:47:29

Ah ki: Time to play!!

Ah ki: Sometimes I am not so energetic so
I nap all day!

Ah ki: Sometimes I get so excited when they
bring me out

We go to the park and I run all I want!

There are some rare times I get to eat durians
too!

I love durians and never pass off an opportunity
to have one piece.

If I do get a chance to find a mud pool, I
get lucky to roll!

But they don't like me getting myself all
muddy.

If they get too angry they would even trim
my dirty fur.

Well, that's all about my life as a dog.

What do you think?

Tiring huh?


## Nap and dreams
### 3:47:29 - 4:07:29

Yeah it can be tiring being me..

I need a nap,

Sometimes I nap the whole afternoon,

and like to be left alone but sometimes

a belly rub is fine with me ...

Sometimes, when I dream about scary things,
I can cry out in my sleep.

Sometimes I dream about a trip to the beach.

I hear my mom calling me but I can't find
her.

I didn't give up finding.

I could hear her but I couldn't see her.

I searched at the bottom of lakes, it was
tiring.

Rested.

Then went into a dark alley leading to a nearby
forest.

There were strangers everywhere looking at
me

but I was only looking for mom.

I was devastated.

I couldn't find mom.

Where is mom~~~~~????

Suddenly I woke up.

I realise I was safe with mom all along.


## Some days I need to share my toys too.
### 4:08:29-4:24:14

Some days I had to share my toys unwillingly.

Me: Can you lend me your yoda toy to film?

Just a while, please?

Me: Please may I just borrow for a while?

Ah ki: Read my eyes.

Ah ki: I am still waiting.

Me: I borrowed her yoda toy for filming.

She's not happy about it.

(Fine, I'll get another one of your toy)

I thought you want your Yoda toy?

You want this too?

Play with your yoda, here.

No.

I want the other one.

The one you are using.

Read my eyes.

Ok, I give you this I use Yoda ok?
