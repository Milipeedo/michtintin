# How to vectorise art work with illustrator FAST!

{{< youtube vtak1rkB2vc>}}

## Introduction.
### 00:00-0:07
Hi Everyone. Today I'm going to show you how you can vectorise your artwork or your sketches fast with image trace from illustrator.


## Import image.
### 0:07-0:43

Let's import our drawing. It has to be high contrast. It will be difficult for you to trace if it's.. it's not on a single colored background or a white colored background. Then, you click on the drawing.
## Tracing with Line art vs Sketch art.
### 0:43-2:37:04

Click embed and then you choose the line art. This is the cleanest method which gives the least anchor points, but if your drawings are not, the lines are not joined. It would require a lot of editing. Let's undo. Another method is silhouette. Stop. Another method is a black and white.

Sketch art.

The mode is black and white so you can expand it and you can see all the paths that you generated, so you can edit from here if you want. But the paths, the paths are wrapped around the pixels. So you have actually... you have actually an island here in comparison to the

tracing we have just now. Where this is actually one line. I'll show you. Line art so it has less anchor points which means less editing and less heavy file. Expand. You see it has less anchor points so you can move. Move this line around edit just one line instead of editing an island. I hope this helps. I'll see you next video.
