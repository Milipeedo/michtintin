## Introduction.
### 00:00-0:18

Hi Everyone. Today I'm going to show you how to create a depth of field effect on

Adobe Photoshop CC. We are going to use a smart object method which is non-destructive and you can undo each step to see if you have overdone your photos. So let's get started.


## Duplicate and feathering selection
### 0:18-1:30

We're going to do(duplicate) a new copy of the original photo. Then once you haveÂ   
duplicated the image, turn into a smart object
and then click on a select icon. Key in 10 pixels. I want to show you what's the difference between 10 pixels feathering and 500 pixels feathering. So select the middle part that we want to focus on. So this is the effect of 10 pixels feathering then let's try out 500.


## Quick masking to check the effect of selection
### 1:30-2:21

Click on quick mask and you can see the edge of the selection is very smooth and very soft,
with the higher number of feathering but we don't want to go to that extent.  
Command D to select and we go 300. Command D check on it. Yeap! That's what I want.

## Blurring the outside of selection
### 2:21-2:54

Then now,  you want to you're going to blur whatever is outside so you have to inverse the selection. Shift+ Command I and then go to filter, blur Gaussian blur and choose 15 pixels then click on the preview to see the effect and click OK. Then we will do the...


## Gradient fill effect aka vignette effect
### 2:54-4:10

This effect, gradient fill effect.

Click on this icon and click on gradient. Choose radial. Choose radial or diamond. Then click inverse. Reverse and enlarge the scale of your gradient double click on the gradient to open up the editor and increase the density on the edges. Then once you're happy with it click OK and

click okay. From here you can adjust the opacity. You can always go back to edit it here. Click okay. Okay.

## Apply filter to create warmer colour
### 4:10-4:49

Then we will do the filter,  to create a warmer look. Photo filter and

there we have it. Before and After. Thanks for watching.
