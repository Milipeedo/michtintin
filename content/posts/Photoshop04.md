# Recording watercolour canvas effect action & replaying with ONE button in Adobe Photoshop CC 2018.

{{< youtube nqcURBKWI7Y>}}

## Introduction.
### 00:00-0:08

Hi Everyone. My name is Michele and in
this tutorial I'm going to show you how

to do this.
Creating a watercolor effect with one

button. Let's get started.

## Open up a drawing and pick a brush.
### 0:08-0:53
So once you've
open up a drawing which is 300 pixels

per inch. Size, any size is up to you. Then
you choose, you don't have to have a

watercolor brush. Just pick any hard edged
brush. I am using hard round pressure

size as I'm using a tablet. Then you just
create a blob of color. Now we will start

recording the action for watercolor
effect. First of all make sure that

you're in painting workspace.

## Start recording action that changes the regular brush to watercolour brush.
### 0:53-2:01

Then,
you open up your action panel this is my

previous action. I'll just delete it and
we'll make our own new one. Go to the

last action that you have in your panel.
If you don't see this you have to turn

off your button mode. This is the "button
mode" Turn it off, Go to the last action,

create a new layer and name it
watercolor effect. Then start

recording.

Collapse it and then turn on your layer.
Every time you click something it will

record. So the next time that we draw we
just need to press the play button to

create the effect.

## Recording your action into a folder.
### 2:01-2:56

Let me show you, okay
we want this to be in a folder, so we

will create a folder first. Just drag and
drop it into a folder then the

"Watercolor effect" will record "make group"
then inside this group effect make sure

the group is selected. Create a layer
mask this button. Add layer mask and then

go to Fill. Select your favorite... Select
your favorite texture watercolor paper

texture.
And then you click OK you will see that

effect immediately applied. And then next
we want to create a washed-out effect of

light and dark. Some area has darker
patch of blue. Some area has lighter

patch of blue.

## Adding pattern onto the colour.
### 2:56-4:57

 Click on effects and then
click on pattern overlay, this time we

will use Cloud. Pattern, Select Cloud. If
you don't see this, it should be inside,

you click on patterns and you click append but it should be inside your list this

is cloud and I make sure the size is as
big as you want. Too small it looks a bit

odd. So increase or reduce opacity to
your preference. I think this will do

maybe a little more. Ok. Overlay the blend
mode is Overlay. A bit more because

whenever a watercolour dries edges are
usually a bit darker because that's

where the color pools
so we'll create that effect with

Inner glow, with grey. Then choose Color burn. Now, for

this one we need to play around with it.

You see how the edges are getting darker
because we are using grey so it's a bit

like alpha channel so darkens wherever
it's darker. Since you are.. since you have

chosen grey so the inner glow...the effect
that the inner glow create is.. the edges,

are darker so depends on how dark you
want to be, the darker the grey the

darker your blue is.

## Stopping recording of actions and testing the record.
### 4:57-6:38

Okay? and then size
adjust the size to your preference and

then maybe it's slightly too dark then
go back to a pattern overlay to adjust

your patches of water that bleeds in
your paper

Once you're done. Click OK and it will be
recorded in this layer so basically done.

So click Stop and now watch the magic
happen. Go and find your

"Watercolour Effect" let's remove this and then create
a new layer let's move this aside and

then you color with only any solid color
and then press the button and it will

create the water color effect. That's all
for today and I'll leave a link to

download the water color effect if you
want to download it instead of doing

yourself I'll see you in the next video.
Bye
