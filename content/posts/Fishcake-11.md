## Transforming pure fish into cakes by hand using spanish mackerels, salt and pepper. No additives just pure fish.

{{< youtube -EMj8NScujg >}}

Hi! There. Do you wanna learn how to make fish cakes by hand?
Today we're going to show you just that. It's a very common ingredient in flat noodles, fried rice, noodles, fish soup noodles in Singapore and Malaysia. Not all types of mackerels are suitable to make fish cakes some don't hold up to their firmness and tend to be powdery so make sure you pick one with
spotted skin and request the fishmonger to fillet it for you if I'm not wrong
it's called Japanese/ Spanish mackerels and before I start working on the fish cakes it's best to line the table with a layer of thick newspaper so that it's easier to clean later the other two ingredients you need are salt and white grounded pepper you also need a saline solution with a ratio of one teaspoon to a cup of water dip your spoon into the saline solution and gently start scraping from the top towards the skin break up the fillet into manageable sections and do it slowly watch out for bones along the length of
the middle spine if you feel or see any bones remove them once you're done scraping check to see if you missed out any bones if not put
them aside. You may not proceed to scrap the next fillet
remember to scrap slowly and gently when you reach the stomach cavity can choose to throw away this part or you can choose to be very careful to not
include any blood clots along the stomach lining . It can smell very fishy Once you're done place the fish into a bowl for seasoning and kneading add a bit of salt and white grounded pepper to taste. In this video we added about a quarter teaspoon of salt and pepper don't forget the saline solution also
add salt into the fish so when you add salt into a fish do go sparingly you
don't want to have a salty fish cake. In order to start kneading prepare a bowl
of fresh salted water once you've wet your hands of the salted
water press and fold with the heel of your palm keep kneading until the
consistency feels like a smooth paste and the longer you need the finer the
texture we did this for about 20 minutes and if you want it to be even finer you
can use a cleaver to means the dough but today we are not going to give it a
mincing treatment we don't mind a bit of lump in the fish cake it feels more
homemade and rustic that way if the arm gets tired you can pick up the dough and
slam it onto the chopping board it's quite fun actually but make sure you
have a sturdy table if your hands get sticky remember to dip your hands into those salted water. When you have needed about 30 minutes it will feel smooth and springy .Compress order to remove any bubbles and then shape it into a 2-inch thick disc next get your knife and wet it with the salted water this will prevent your fish cake from sticking onto the blade. Cut your fish dough into 1 to 2 inch thick slices if you see some muscle fibers still intact don't worry about it once you fry it you won't be able to see it. Oh and do you know you can also make fish balls out of these fish cakes just roll them up in your palm and squeeze and scoop squeeze and scoop it's that easy place all the fish balls into the salted water to retain the freshness preferably covering the top of the fish bowl when you're ready let's move to the stuff to start frying heat up about 2 tbsp of cooking oil on your wok and when it starts smoking lift your fish cakes gently onto the wok, you don't want them to break apart just at the last minute. Fry them at a medium heat until it is brown and then that's it you can let it cool and then slice them into thin pieces then you can add them into your fried noodles fried rice or any dishes we should have added some cooking oil before we started frying the fish balls as you can see the fish balls got stuck so we added some more oil and continued to fry. Rremember to be patient when you fry the slower the fire the less possibility that it will get burnt. Try not to turn it if it sticks to the wok that means it's not brown enough but patience is the virtue not bestowed upon everyone. I think a better way to cook these fish balls is to boil them in hot boiling water. Thank you for watching and please click like or subscribe there'll be more videos coming. And as for the fish skin bury it where you have your veggies or flowers growing. Your plants you thank you bye
