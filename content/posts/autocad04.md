# Plotting precise boundary line using survey coordinates.

## Introduction.
### 00:00-00:0

Hi Everyone. In this video I'm going to show you how to import an image into AutoCAD and vectorise it and export it into illustrator. Convert it into editable path in Illustrator.
## Import an image and fade it.
### 00:18-00:59

So first of all, let's import an image or sketch into AutoCAD. We pick our drawing. JPEG or PNG is fine or even PDF would be okay. 10x bigger and then zoom in. Then let's fade our drawing so that it's easier to look at our line. Increase the fade  percentage to about 80%

## Draw continous polyline with arc and line.
### 00:59-08:01

and then the first command will be P L spacebar and then we start with the first stroke. Click on the point, and then press the spacebar. D spacebar. D is direction, so you change the direction. either it's left or right.  So once you have clicked, you locked in the direction. So click. So now the direction of the line is towards the left. So now you want to go to the right. You type D spacebar click on the middle point and it's arc so you can continue to draw and then D spacebar and then click on a point so there's a break here so we just spacebar to break the line to commit the line and then repeat PL again by pressing space bar and then click.

So once you click it's a straight line so you change it Arc. A spacebar.  S spacebar, second point and then you click on your second point whichever you think is the most suitable point. If you if you want to undo just U spacebar or Esc and let's say if you accidentally break the line, you can start again I'll teach you I'll show you how to turn the snap on. I'll show you how to join later below. Spacebar and then A Spacebar. A for Arc.

Let's mirror it. Mirror means reflect in AutoCAD. Mirror means reflect in Illustrator.

and break this line or break this line so that we can redo the line. Remove it.

You don't have to use snap if you don't want to but you're gonna have to trim  

your line later on and I'm gonna show you how to trim. Trim is TR Spacebar select the line the cutting line and then select the item you wanna trim. Okay, so let's export it into illustrator. Erase this, and then...so over here... so every single line that we select is a single path in Illustrator. So if you want to break it you can break it with a Caesar tool in Illustrator or you can break it here if you want to so export it

## Export file as encapsulated file.
### 08:01-08:54
as en.... as encapsulated Photoshop file or as .eps.  I have a temp file here, so Demo file 1.

## Open up Demo file 1 in illustrator.
### 08:54-09:48
So we go to illustrator and open up a new file choose whatever
choose whatever size that you need for your document
We will use this one, then place... go to our
temp folder, Demo File 1.eps and place. Click at the corner and there you go. Embed. Now you can see every single path. Ungroup and grab the line. Zoom in. So we can see


## Edit line in illustrator.
### 10:29-12:04
every polyline is actually a single path in Illustrator. There you go. You can also change the line type.

maybe change ..and then if you want,  you can... you can change the thickness of the line or you can cut with  the scissor tool, here. So you shorten. You basically shorten the path that you have drawn in AutoCAD. Then the scissor tool. You can also shorten this...shorten this if you want to. And I hope this video is helpful to somebody out there. I'll see you again in the next video.
