# Align & Scale Shortcut using coordinates for accuracy.

{{< youtube BlmRA92dAYc>}}

## 00:00-00:17 Introduction
Hi Everyone! Today I will be showing you
how to scale a drawing with a carpark lot on the plan.
A carpark lot is 2.4 meters
by 5.8 meters, so if you have a
scanned plan which is out of scale, you can
use this method to scale it.
## 00:18-1:20 Draw one side of a carpark lot to scale of 1:1.
First, you need to draw a horizontal line so that
you can use it as a reference line to
rotate the carpark, to align with the line.
This will make scaling easier and more
accurate. Ok, let us draw a 5800
millimetres length line from this
base point at a carpark corner and then we
will rotate the car park and scale it.
Next draw a line that has the same angle
as the carpark lot. It is slightly slanted, so turn Ortho.

## 1:21-2:00 Rotate plan to match reference line.
and then we will rotate the line and the
plan to match the horizontal line so

R O enter. Select the plan and select the
line. Then click on a base point.

R spacebar, R means reference; and then
click the base point again.

Click the edge and click the end of the carpark lot
line; and then hover on top of this

line and click, and there we are.
We have rotated the whole thing to align

to our reference line.
## 2:01-2:51 Scale the whole plan with reference line method.
Now we need to scale it up so that the
side of the the length of the carpark lot

is the same as our reference line which
is 5800 mm,
so SC enter or SC spacebar
then click on the base point, then R enter,

which means reference then click on
the end of the carpark lot. Then we want

the end to be at the end of our
reference line. So click the second point

and there it is. We have scaled the plan
successfully. That's it.
