# 7 Dimension tricks you need to know about.

{{< youtube YDUxrUKs2S0 >}}

## Introduction.
### 00:00-00:49:08
Hi, How's it going?

Today I'll be showing you how to do
Dimension using shortcuts.

So I have a row of boxes here to dimension
Usually beginners will dimension this way.

You'll go and click dimension and then turning
on Object Snap, you will click each point

one by one, making sure that they are aligned,
and this is really time consuming.

So I want to show you some shortcuts that
will save you a lot of time especially doing

construction drawings and blow up plans.

So lets delete this.


## Quick dimension.
### 00:49-01:43

Now the shortcut for Quick Dimension is
QDIM.

Let's say you want to dimension this whole
row, only this top edge.

QDIM, Spacebar, Select the edge that you want
to dimension and before you click anything

after you have just selected, hold your mouse
wherever direction you want your dimension

to be.
Let's say it is this top end.

You press Spacebar, it will automatically
generate towards that direction.

Let's put 1m.Let's do it again.

Quick Dimension.

Click the edge that you want, Hold the mouse
cursor where you want the dimension to be,

press Spacebar and that's it.

## Continuous dimension
### 01:43-03:16
Let's start with Continuous.

Continuous Dimension, How do you use it?

You have to start with a regular dimension
for this one.

So Quick Dimension.

QDIM, Spacebar.

1m,
Ok, Let's do continuous dimension, DIMCONT.

So once you clicked the command, Once you
have pressed Enter, It will automatically

generate Continuous Dimension from the edge
of the first dimension you have created.

So just click on the next point that you want
you dimension to end, and then just, continue.

This is useful for Setting Out Plan where
you have, heaps of dimension to put out for

the contractor to build.

So this is Continuous Dimension.

## Baseline Dimension
### 03:16-05:07

DIMBASE.

Oh, for this command you need to create a
regular dimension first.

Ok, DIMBASE.

So what it does is, it will generate from
the starting point of your first dimension.

Generate dimension continuously on top of
the previous dimension.

This is also good for setting out plan and
construction drawings.

All the dimensions are overlapping.

What do you do?

How do you adjust it so that it is just, the
spacing is just nice.

There's a trick in dividing this exactly so
that it doesn't overlap.

The trick is, Dimension Space.

DIMSPACE.

Spacebar.

Select the Base Dimension, Select the dimension
you want to space out.

Spacebar.

Leave it as auto mode.

It will automatically space out the dimensions
nicely for you.


## Dimension break
### 05:14-06:16

The next trick I'm going to show you is, Dimension
Break.

Now what is Dimension break.

Sometimes your dimensions and your leader
annotations, overlap.

What do you do?

Now this is where Dimension Break comes in.

The shortcut is DIMBREAK.

Spacebar.

Select the dimension line that you want to
break.

Go for Auto, auto is fine too.

I prefer manual.

Anyway, Auto and then Spacebar.

It will automatically break, the point where
it overlaps.

If you want to use manual, DIMBREAK, Select
this dimension.

Go for manual.M, Spacebar.

Click the first point that you want to break
and the second point and it will break the

two points that you have clicked.

Got it?


## Dimension style
### 06:16-07:56

Ok, what else?Hmmm..Dimension style, Oh, If
you want to generate Baseline Dimension which

automatically space out evenly, Let me show
you.

Let's say you want to do Baseline Dimension
again and it goes ahead and overlap again

and you're really annoyed by it and you want
to change so that it doesn't overlap, you

don't have to do the dimension spacing.

What you do is you go to Dimension Style.

DIMSTYLE.

Spacebar.

Modify it.

Go to Lines.

Increase the, maybe 4.

Try out whatever distance that you prefer.

ok.

Let me delete this.

DIMBASE.

Spacebar.

Yup.

So after you have changed all the spacing
of your Baseline Dimension will be on top

of each other.

If you put a higher figure, it will be further.

## Dimension ordinate
### 07:56-15:22

The next trick I'm going to show you is, Dimension
Ordinate.

Now I have a plan here of a table that I have
drawn of a 5m by 2m . So I want to, let's

say I want to start all the measurements from
the centre.

Centre of the drawing.

So this is my central point.

So I have prepared a ruler here to help us
understand this method easier.

Let me check that it's actually the center.

Yup. ok.

Now that we have the ruler we can delete the
reference point.

You don't have to use this ruler but its for
tutorial purposes.

It's easier to understand.

So let's go ahead and activate the command.

Now before we activate the command.

We need to change our origin point to this
point.

Because right now if you use this command,
DIMORDINATE Click this point and and 16246.

What number is this?

We have no idea what number is this.

Our origin point is not starting from the
center of the table, it's actually starting

from the centre of this point.

So what you're reading is, the distance between
here and oh sorry.

The distance between

this point and this point.

So 16246, here 16246.

Now we don't want to measure from that random
origin point.

Let's move our origin point to the center
of the table.you type UCS.

Spacebar.

And the click, make sure you click on this
intersection point.

Have your snap point on.

Object snap on.

F3.

Click, when once you click the origin X and
Y axis will be still moving freely so you

need to first click the end point of X axis
and then Click the end point of the Y axis.

You need to do this 3 Clicks to fix the origin
point.

Now you can save this location at UCS Manager.

UCSMAN.

Spacebar.

You can rename it.

Now it's called unnamed.

You can rename it as Table origin.

So next time if you come back to this drawing
and your UCS...Oh there's a duplicate.

Name, Table Origin 2.

If you come back to this drawing and your
UCS is not where it is, you don't have to

redo it.

You just have to..

Oh in order to reset it, UCS Spacebar, Spacebar.
and you want to go back to table origin just

click this one and it will snap back.

And then if you want to ...Ok, let's use our
Dimension Ordinate, come back to our Dimension

Ordinate.

Now we want to measure the distance of this
point.

Have your Ortho On.

This one, Command L or F8.

It can only measure from X or Axis.

It's great for things with only right angles
tables, squares , rectangles and when you

have your Ortho On, it will snap to either
X axis of Y axis.

So when you click on this point.

Just pull out and click.

This is measuring along the Y ruler.

So it's 2150.

2000 is here, so it's just after 2000.

Next is, measuring using the X ruler, so the
point is actually here.

Using the X ruler.

Let's do the same for this.

Using Y ruler.

If you want to fix like, sometimes, you move
your mouse around it will change to X and

Y readings.

You want to fix it to Y just type Y enter.

Or Y Spacebar.

If you move to the X axis, it will still stay
at, it will still stay using the Y ruler.

and just click.

Repeat command Spacebar, click and Let's use
X ruler.

See even if I move down here it doesn't snap
to the Y ruler, and just click.

Same thing here.

Still changes, but I don't want it to change
anymore.

Y Spacebar.

So it doesn't change the ruler it measures
from . So this is simple enough.

I hope you understand my explanation and not
confuse you instead.

And let me know if you find it useful.

Thank you.
