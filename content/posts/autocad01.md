# Align & Scale Shortcut using coordinates for accuracy.

{{< youtube n496RcJjkkY >}}

## 00:00-00:09  Introduction
Hello, everyone. This video is about how
to Scale and Align your drawing if you

only have two coordinates.

## 00:10-00:16 Check default units.
Check that the
units are all in millimetres, or type

"UNITS", spacebar.

## 00:17-00:27 Attach reference image plan.
Bring in the drawing with
Reference Manager, "REF" spacebar.

and then click attach and select
your drawing.

Check that the unit is in millimetres and
then click OK

## 00:28-00:41 Attach reference image to origin point at scale 1:1   .
Attach it to the origin point, "0,0,0" so that
it's easier to navigate at scale of 1 to 1.

## 00:42-00:49 Identify 2 coordinates on image from survey plan.
Let's begin to scale and align with
one command. Pick two opposite diagonal

point of coordinates. Preferably on the
boundary line.

## 00:50-01:59 Key in the coordinates to the dynamic input.
Key in the coordinates of
X, as a positive number and Y as a
negative number.

Remove the decimal points to convert
from meters to millimetres,

and then key in y as a negative number.

Repeat the same thing for Point no.2, remove the decimal points and Positive x and Negative y.

## 2:00-2:12 True coordinates on cad space shows on screen.
And there you have it! Two true
coordinates on the drawing of your

boundary line.


Now you have to scale the
drawing to these two points. Move the

drawing area to the two points and then
key in a line and space bar.


## 2:13-2:57 Align and scale the drawing.
Select your

drawing and click on the first point, and
then click on actual coordinate point,

and then click on a second reference
point

and click on the true coordinate point.

after you clicked, Press spacebar to
continue. Autocad will prompt if you want

to align and scale the object. Click yes
or "Y" spacebar and then that's it!
