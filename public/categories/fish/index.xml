    <description><![CDATA[Transforming pure fish into cakes by hand using spanish mackerels, salt and pepper. No additives just pure fish. Introduction and picking the right fish. 00:00-00:30 Hi! There. Do you wanna learn how to make fish cakes by hand? Today we&rsquo;re going to show you just that. It&rsquo;s a very common ingredient in flat noodles, fried rice, noodles, fish soup noodles in Singapore and Malaysia. Not all types of mackerels are suitable to make fish cakes some don&rsquo;t hold up to their firmness and tend to be powdery so make sure you pick one with spotted skin and request the fishmonger to fillet it for you, if I&rsquo;m not wrong it&rsquo;s called Japanese/ Spanish mackerels.]]></description>
